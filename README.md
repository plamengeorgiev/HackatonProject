HackatonProject
===============

Our project sees to the public's lack of information and awareness of ecological issues and disasters.

We combined a couple of ideas in order to make a project of a much larger scale. Currently our main focus is the city of Sofia.
With time passing, more regions will be added and functionality will increase.

Currently implemented ideas:
	- Recycle information:
		= Provides user with information on each colour bin's functionality and items to dispose of in;
		= Provides location information for current positions of coloured bins for separate collection.
	- Natural disasters information:
		= Provides user with basic information on activities to partake in case of different natural disaster;
		= Gives a report on expected natural disasters by regions.
	- Report system:
		= Users can report any recycling/pollution misbehaviours;
		= Users receive reports on any possible natural disasters in the area (registered users only);
		= Users can view any scheduled maintenances in selected area.
